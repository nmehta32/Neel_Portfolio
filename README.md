# [Project 1: Analyzing the Impact of Social Support on Depression using Causal Inference](https://github.com/nmehta32/Causality-between-support-and-depression)

This project is focused on understanding the impact of social support on individuals who have self-reported a diagnosis of depression on Twitter. Using natural language processing and machine learning techniques, we aimed to determine the causal effect of social support on depression through tweets. The project includes data scraping using the Twint and Tweepy libraries, data preprocessing, and the implementation of advanced machine learning models such as BERT and logistic regression for analysis. The results of the study showed an average treatment effect of 1.96, providing insight into the potential benefits of social support for individuals with depression.
